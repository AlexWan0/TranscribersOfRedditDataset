I've been trying to take in the experience. It's incredible. I'm so glad I canceled my apartment lease to sleep at Walmart. The hideout I made in the paper towel section is becoming more cozy and homelike the more items I find in the store to add to it. I actually found a small mattress which fits in my hideout. Saturday night I was wandering around the store after closing time and tried a lot of different beers. This is great. Unknown Commenting Redditor Unknown Karma This is fake there is no way you could pull this off. The paper towel sections get shopped and restocked at such a fast rate that someone would notice you being in there. Also there is the fact that there are overnight crews that stocks the freight sets the mods and takes care of the floor and cleaning. You would not be able to walk around unnoticed. Even if you were in one of the stores that went to daystocking there are still people there setting mods overnight and taking care of the floors and cleaning. There is people in the building at all times. So please /r/quityourbullshit Source: am a manager at Walmart and they all run the same process

The college kids kind of steered me to a record with a picture of Queen Elizabeth on the cover instead of the Little Red Hen and I liked the tiara so I unknowingly bought a Sex Pistols album and demanded to listen to it because I spent my birthday money on it. Later that year my mom and I went on a trip to England and I saw the same picture and that the band was playing somewhere so when my mother was asleep I left the hotel in London and got a cab to the place where the Sex Pistols were playing really I was hoping that the queen would be there with her tiara and I almost managed to get inside but the club manager decided that a 7 year old who brought a stuffed Paddington bear was too punk rock for the show so I sat in the lobby and waited for my mother who came with the police to pick me up I did get the album I brought signed but later it got tossed when I moved and I regret that now. Because it was the 70's I got spanked and I think I might still be grounded. There is nothing scarier than the anger of a parent after they have been scared for their child's welfare and then discover that child is fine and at a punk rock show.

Yes some women are looser than others. Correction: Slightly looser. But tightness/ looseness is not as varied as penis for example. It makes very little difference I have a 7in circumference and I've been inside my fairs are of pussies [surrounded by golden brackets] I've felt what your friend would call loose and I've been with girls where we were simply unable to have sex because of the pain it caused themthis will be further explained. Its all normal. It all feels good if you do it right. NOW the reason why your friend is beyond retarded is simple. Pussies expand. They're not like dicks where we have one size and ""baby im sorry thats all you're gonna get."" The more excited the girl is the more relaxed she'll be. The more relaxed she is the looser her muscles will be. Remember the vagina is a muscle. To put it simply the hornier the looser. You'd be surprised what can fit in there when they're really turned on. The only times i have not been able to penetrate a girl were during drunken one night stands where i as focused on pleasing myself and didn't really care how turned on they got as long as i got to bust a nut. THEREFORE: there are 3 possible reasons for your friend to make a statement like that btw im assuming you're in high school because with that mentality he's never gonna get laid in college. NUMBER 1: Most likely Your friend's pride was hurt. Maybe he came too quickly. Maybe she made a comment. Whatever the case theres no valid reason to make a comment like that. NUMBER 2: Your friend wacks it with the death grip. Sorry bud you're setting the bar to high for girls your fingers unlike a pussy are actively applying force to/ around your penis. Loosen up your grip Forrest Griffin NUMBER 3: And most likely The girl isn't to blame your friend just has a pencil dick. Theres a 4th reason and the only reason its not a part of the list is because i sincerely doubt its the case: Your friend is a fantastic lay he spent an hour preheating the oven got her all loosened up and wet. Also im assuming he wasn't fucking a 6ft5 girl with the hips equally wide as a baobab. In any case NOT ONLY IS YOUR FRIEND IGNORANT HES ALSO A HUGE ASSHOLE Be a gentleman with your lady. you can fuck her like the dirty little slut she is [end of screen]"

I have been feeling especially burdened for her family recently because her dad lost his job a few months back due to the political unrest in their country. So at the beginning of this month I committed to sending her family 1 for each new ambassador who joins my team in March. I was hoping and praying for 100 new joins that would have been a HUGE accomplishment and was committed to sending at least that amount regardless. Well God is delivering on those prayers in a way I never expected I'm completely humbled and seriously in awe. As of right now my team has grown by over 250 ambassadors this month That's more than double our previous record and the month is not yet done. I never would have even thought to dream of a number this large... this is undoubtedly ALL God. At Mom's group yesterday I was reminded that God is always working in the big picture... as He is working this miracle for Hazel's family He is also working in my life and in the lives of each person on my team. His plan is such an intricate weaving of people circumstances blessings trials miracles and promises. Through this I am being reminded of the power of prayer and the fact that God is honored by our faith and by our giving. I have so much to learn and so much growth to do but I am so thankful tor the way He continues to work in me despite my stubbornness selfishness pride and mustardseedsized faith.

I have to go back and look because she wanted to get the titer done for herself and her husband and I'm curious what that result was.

They see sex as a resource that has to be extracted from the female body through force manipulation or payment. It's something that can be redistributed bought or stolen just like a tv or a laptop. We don't talk about men needing to attend dinner parties or needing to belong to a bowling team because we recognize those as social activities that need the participation of everyone involved. You can't mandate friendship it requires the intent of more than one person. We need to start thinking of sex this way. When you say that men need sex remember that sex is an activity you do WITH SOMEONE ELSE. It can never be neutrally given. Sex should be done because two people want to have sex not because a man needs to be given it. [Black]: I remember my mother and my aunt giving me a talk in private about how sex ""should"" work in a relationship. They said that men need sex and sometimes it's just necessary to let him plow you for 5 mins when you aren't in the mood because that's compromise I was I...like 15. I was so disgusted. No one considered that him taking a cold shower and putting his dick away FOR HER is also compromise... but one that doesn't absolve someone's autonomy. Oho then she implied that I would never get a husband because I called that rapey. Apparently one is supposed to give away their bodily rights once they marry. Dear women: you don't have to marry nor do you EVER need to do sexual favors for a man."

Especially from a woman to another woman who finds her work empowering and exciting. I wish you the best in anything you do and I hope you learn how to be kinder to fellow women. OP: Rudeness is DMing hundreds of women only with intention of selling overpriced products and not actually caring about the people you're interacting with. How many times do you copy and paste the same message trying to sell your pyramid scheme item to people you don't know and don't care to know Women empowerment would be supporting those who create and sell their own products not predatory MLM companies. Truly I hope you can do some research and find that these companies are terrible. If ever interested look at reddit.com/r/antimlm for more information on the nature of MLM companies."

b69dmk,https://reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/b69dmk/autonomous_trap/,https://i.redd.it/l5o24poj2qo21.png,[Unknown] Unknown date and time There was a 20 foot long balance beam over a pit. It was a short fall from the beam into the pit which was full of tar. Falling into the pit wasn't lethal at all just annoying as heck. The far side was reverse angled ____ and smooth as glass preventing anyone from wading through the tar and just climbing it. It didn't help that the obvious handholds on the near side turned out to be greased. The balance beam was just out of reach while standing in the pit. The tricky part was whenever someone started walking across a wooden pole with a boxing glove on the end would randomly shoot out of the wall and knock them into the pit. They couldn't find a trigger for it and were failing the multiple dodge/acrobatics rolls to avoid the pole and maintain their balance on the beam. They also couldn't pick up any signs of magic in the area. Finally someone had the bright idea to ask if listening for the mechanism activating would give them a dodge bonus. The other party members decided to listen in as well. That was when they heard faint giggling. A very well hidden door was quickly discovered and they pulled the culprit out of his secret room. There were multiple ports that he could stick the boxing glove pole through and a crank that he proudly explained would rotate the balance beam if someone managed dodge and get too close to the end. A rope dangled from the ceiling. Yanking that would dump a box of glitter from above the pit. He had been waiting to use that until everyone was covered in tar. Needless to say the party took him prisoner and used him as a guinea pig for the rest of the area. [Anonymous] 02/27/2019 19:58:42 That is fucking amazing I love it

One of the guys kept mocking me again and again which I brushed off. This pinnacled when one of said bullies said to me ""l bet you haven't even put your dick in your gfs clit yet"". Now was my chance to toss the humiliation back there way. ""No I haven't mate whats a clit mate"" I responded They laughed threw a rock at me and said ""the part you put your dick into idiot"". The proverbial ball was now in my court. ""l think you mean the Vagina mate the clits located a bit higher up between the labia majora you don't seem to know much about female biology But I suppose thats why you sleep with 14 year old girls"" I blurted out expecting to get the shit kicked out of me.

I did a ton of research a while back wish I could find my notes now. I think the two things that stood out to me were 1 the amount of revenue generated by onetime fees and monthly fees to maintain access to the online portal and 2 the number of new recruits vs net increase in reps. It looked like a lot of money was flowing into the company from reps who ended up recovering very little or nothing and then quitting. There was something like a 10 retention rate. The other 90 put money in and got nothing out.. but their recruiter still gets paid. It really looked bad. Sorry man I'm not interested and will definitely warn others.

There are approx 3 billion penis owners in the world. For you to increase the average by that amount you would need to raise total global penis length from 11.4 billion inches to 16.5 billion inches. This gives you a penis length of 5100000000 inches or 129540 KM. This is enough for your penis to circle around the Earth's equator 3.2 times. Your penis reaches half way to the moon.

At the time I had taken a few years off because of family issues and was looking to get back in. The coach knew I was good enough to start on varsity but wouldn't play me and instead put me on JV. He told me it was because i wasn't good enough but it was really because he was a terrible and biased coach or racist towards white kids trying to play a sport he thought was only for Portuguese and Brazilians. He was Portuguese himself. So one day at practice after telling me and some other kids we were terrible players. He went onto the other team and played with the starters against us. I took the ball from him schooled the defense and put the ball past the goalie. He was amazed and asked why I hadn't played like that all year. I then told him what I thought of him as a coach and walked off the field. He didn't know that I had been scouted by and made it onto the US JR Olympic team prior to quitting soccer previously. I wish every day that I never quit.

Plexus is soooo much more than weight balance You may experience more energy reduced discomfort better sleep hormone balance reduced sugar craving decreased inflammation decreased anxiety hair regrowth clearer skin decreased brain fog and SO many other amazing things as your body becomes BALANCED and HEALTHY Suddenly eating better becomes SO much easier because your body isn't craving junk. Your workouts become SO much more effective because your body has more natural energy and is ready to burn excess fat and build muscle.

People are still calling network marketing a scam. Nothing makes me eye roll more Our companies are registered businesses that pay GST We are held to the high standards of the direct selling association. This protects consumers and sellers equally. We really do make money. At home. On our phones. The amount of money is purely indicative of how much work you do not the level of scamminess. We pay taxes on our earnings. We have to declare our income. We don't have any fees hidden or otherwise that you keep paying and paying for no substance. We have high quality products. That you aren't forced to buy every month unless you want to. Pyramid schemes have no products or very low quality products. A legitimate MLM also will not force you to buy high levels of inventory for stock on hand. extravagant income claims by suggesting you do very little work. Your income is directly the result of the effort you put in. 73 years. This is how long Tupperware has operated. 56 years Mary Kay. 133 years Avon. All MUIti level direct selling network marketing. All legitimate and renowned. Why Many reasons. Because it cuts out a ton of costs for the company to have people advertise and sell its products than getting it into stores with celebrity endorsements while earning people more money on their own terms. Heard of new age influencers No different. There are 100 absolute scams out there. Ponzi schemes. Pyramid schemes. Big buy ins with no substantial products where the people at the top get richer and the plebs just spend their own hard earned money. Recently did you hear about the Fyre music festival watch the doco on Netflix Ponzi 100. I think the only industry that you would be judged more in is sex work You can 100 make a casual part time or full time income working from home direct selling influencing multi level or network marketing. Your success is purely determined on your effort level of commitment and consistency. If you're interested in a joining a company RESEARCH. Find a company that has products or services you love and can stand behind a company that represents a valued mission and stands for something you believe in.

When I heard that I became immediately concerned because I would hate for you to get caught up in something that could be a detriment to your wellbeing. I'm sure you've heard this before but I find that there is strong evidence pointing to Amway and other network marketing/MLM companies as being predatory and manipulative. I understand that you have the expertise in business that I do not so you might know something about it that I do not. However I do have strong theological and philosophical training...and I can see a cult from a mile away. When money becomes the object of religious worship there is a real problem and from my research it seems that Amway fits the bill. Not only this it's business practices seem to skirt the ethical line continually. I know you to be a very good person [GREY] and I respect you and your family a lot. As such I felt obligated to share this with you. Maybe I'm wrong about Amway...but I doubt it. Please read this academic paper by Dr. Jon M. Taylor on the subject of network marketing companies. I think you'll find it interesting if nothing else. Also if this message offends you please know that is not my intention. We've known each other for a long time and you've always been a good friend to me. But if it does offend you maybe you should ask yourself as to why that is the case. I'm only trying to be a friend. www.ftc.gov: ftc.gov [GREY]: No disrespect [BLUE] but you have zero credibility to talk to me about what I'm involved in. You don't know who I'm in business with and certainly don't have any grounds to tell me why i shouldn't pursue something. I know your heart and i get why you reached out. But simply said your just wrong. I know you don't know any better. Your judging people's morals values and intentions simply on the name of a company they are associated with. In my experience and what i believe in that's wrong. I don't know what you researched but i can tell you right now if I researched you on internet i might just think similar stuff. Am i wrong to think that Every single person and company have an image. And your image of Amway is wrong. Lastly let me educate you: More Money more ways i can make a difference for Christ. Less money less ways i can make a difference for Christ. The people I'm in business with believe that simple concept. If that doesn't make sense call me at [REDACTED] tonite and i can talk more. [BLUE]: As a friend I do feel like I have the credibility and the responsibility to talk to you my friend about something that I perceive to be concerning. Let's assume that Amway isn't a cult. If you joined any organization that had a public image of being a cult then you would expect your family and your friends who are aware of that image to talk to you about their concerns. That's just what good wellintentioned people do for the people they love. I am not judging the morals values or intentions of the people involved with this company I'm judging the company. That is something Scripture allows us to do. Lastly let me educate you. Jesus was poor. Paul was poor. Peter was poor. Everyone who followed Christ was pretty much poor. That doesn't mean that God hates wealthy people it just means that God uses poor people just like he uses rich people to make a difference. Certainly God loves it when you have enough resources to do awesome things for Him. But He doesn't want you getting those resources through unethical means. I'm not saying that's what you're doing but I am suggesting that is exactly what Amway is doing. I'm sorry I won't be able to talk tonight. But I would love to have a conversation about everything soon. I'm not interested in fighting or losing a friendship because of this so if you don't agree with me about Amway then that is totally fine. I'll respect your decision and pray for you to be successful in whatever you do. [GREY]: Next Friday night we have a meeting why dont you come and ill introduce you to some people i have been able to get in business with lately. Before you go telling everyone who [GREY]: Just so you can understand before you go telling everyone you know what im doing. i want to make sure you really know. [BLUE]: If I can I would be more than happy to go to the meeting. I just have to check my schedule for work I might be working Friday evening. But just know that whether I go to the meeting or not I won't be tarnishing your reputation at all. You're a standup guy in my opinion. I wouldn't drag your name through the dirt.

Facts told here could not correspond to reality. Link to the original post has been given by OP as a reply at this transcription. JMK] I'm being groomed into becoming an anime girl Now I don't really want to reveal my name due to privacy and the media and my mother's career and all that but I'm going to college in a couple months and I'm wondering how am I going to tell my mother/father I'm not a weeb Disclaimer my mother is not a big anime fan but she has a YouTubewide if not internetwide recognition as an anime reviewer. The issue is obviously I want to be a girl but at what point do I just reveal myself I can't just never tell my parents and I also can't just reveal it one day in the future while transitioning. When my mother's YouTube channel is over in likely a couple years I think that'd be the perfect time as she and my dad have had a couple run ins with the media already and I think that she's annoyed by the fact that my father disagrees with her anime opinions publicly. Even after everything I've heard about my mother's anime opinions I still care about her and don't want to harm her YouTube career over a declaration that won't be apparent me for a year or so. So when would be the perfect time for my transitioning to start Should it be immediately When do I start hormones and all that My parents have said they'll prepare me for this but I doubt they still will when they realize what my nonanime interests are. I'm using a throwaway account but I'm guessing that if someone cared enough they'd be able to find me. I'd like to implore you to please not do anything with this information other than jack off to the thought of me.

As a CRNA I am capped off to earning much more than I do now I work for someone else on their time I miss time away from my family and I will do this for the next 30 years. .

At 10:30 i had double chicken cheese burger along with large soda. At 11 i starting fucking my SO like a tiger. We had sex till 2 PM and we were exhausted. So we decided to eat something. I ate a whole 9'' pizza by myself and 3 chocolate dipped oreos as a sweetdish. Then we started fucking again. Then i started feeling a little tension in my stomach but i did not give it much attention. So we were having sex giving heads to each other and whatnot. My SO wanted me to come on top of her with my dick near her face and she wanted me to deepthroat her. So she started deepthroating me. I usually orgasm very intensely when i get deepthroated. So this time also when i was about to orgasm i felt this huge rush of energy flowing down to my pelvic area. I orgasmed but that huge energy rush also brought watery shit out of my anus which was spread all over her torso. It was so smelly that she literally puked. Her puke contained my semen and some other slimy shit. The smell of my shit and my SO's puke was so bad that it made me puke too. I puked on her face.

Fast forward to senior year and she just broke up with her asshole boyfriend for cheating on her. All the guys are salivating at the chance of getting with her before graduation and I muster up the courage to sarcastically ask if she wants to go to the prom with me. My mind is fucking blown away when she enthusiastically says yes. During these years I played a fuck ton of dance dance revolution and while extremely nerdy I have some pretty sick dance moves. During the prom we end up dancing in the middle of the floor and blow the crowd away while her asshole ex boyfriend is sitting at a table by himself drinking out of a flask. We ended up getting crowned king and queen of the prom. Things take off from there I end up starting my own web consulting business straight out of high school sold it for a huge chunk of change and retired early in my 20's. Her asshole ex bf football player from high school works at the local 711 as a cashier which we frequently run into on the weekends. We've been married for over 10 years and she's the best thing that ever happened to me.

Just trying to make you and your followers aware of what they're buying into. The whole structure and integrity of companies that shill products like this are ridiculous. They make outrageous claims that can't be backed up by scientific studies or research. Aside from the cheesy inspirational quotes multitude of copy and paste spam messages and lack of proof aside from photoshop and random google images it's all pushing product. They are predatory 'jobs' preying on single parents desperate people and people who think they can make decent money from these sorts of schemes which is impossible unless you're in the top 1. I work with a lot of people who have bought into schemes like this and have ended up in massive amounts of debt. The fact there's no mention of a company name until it's 'inboxed you hun xoxo bossbabe' is just one of the red flags Yeah I don't agree with it and I have made my opinions known elsewhere but I suppose you can't stop someone making stupid decisions.

The Saga begins where most of my tales of 'what the fuck just happened' did Dark Heresy. Back when I didn't know how the rules worked actually I still don't. On purpose. Back then I cared. I was shown a Random Character Generator for the system. What I ended up With was a guy who had only two real talents: Playing his Bass Guitar and Running. He was mostly broke only owning the cloths on his back his Bass Guitar and a Couch that was 'In remarkably good shape'. He was a psyker one of the really weak ones so weak it was actually impossible to tell IC if he was. He had a look that could only be described as Business casual if it was slept in. For about a week.' When he was described to the group one of my friends remarked 'So you're playing some soft of Magical Hobo' That's where his name came from. The original name that was rolled for was immediately discarded for the moniker of Boxcar Joe the Magic Hobo' If you give me a minute I'll start typing up the shit that happened. Waffle House Millionaire 04/22/11Fri01:32 No.14676032 14675909 First mission for the Inquisitor I wasn't in the group yet. They landed in the hive where I was living to investigate some sort of disappearance of an associate. Boxcar Joe was trying to remember where he put has bottle of Sacra. They met up With some local arbitrators got some leads and went hunting. Boxcar Joe played his Bass with a rhythm so perfect It created an impromptu dance party in the lower hive. The acolytes got into a heated firefight just outside the pub where Boxcar Joe was trying to drink his lunch in peace He stepped out and this is where I became aware of my surroundings. On my left A techpriest some soft of imperial assassin two guardsman and someone who looks like they just stepped out of a pulp PI novel from the 50's. Trench coat fedora whole shebang. On my right 60 genestealers. Give Or Take. I grabbed my bottle and chucked it at the xenos. I wont lie and pretend I remember all of the numbers but: The bottle hit a Hive Tyrant that was invisable for some reason. Said hive tyrant had its eyes burned by the pure alcohol Hive tyrant thrashed into bridge. 30tonnes of Concrete and Dther building materials fall. killing all but two genestealars One is Shot by the detective the other Joe kicks in the face so hard it gets decapitated. I then looked over at the stunned group. ""Offworlders yeah You have to wach the local cockroach population. bastards get real uppity every couple of years."""" I was then shanghaied into the group. I'm not going to tell all the DH related tales but he lasted pretty much the entire campaign. Whenever he was directly involved in a confrontation all rolls would go right to either end of the spectrum. Every other roll was a Crit or a CritFail. In the end he got sucked into the warp surfing his couch. That isn't the end of his story. Waffle House Millionaire 04/22/11Fri01:45 No.14676140 14676032 About a month later I was running a Shadowrun game 4th if it matters. They were all rolling up characters and there was one new guy who wasnt there for the DH game He opted for a random creation thing. Ended up With a technical pacifist Hobo street shaman who lived on a couch in a downtown alleyway. He owned a Bass Guitar AMator shades that looked slightly too big for him and his couch was even described as 'in remarkibly good shape'. We all joked that two different computers With two different random generators had created Boxcar Joe. After explaining why it was so fucked up to the new guy he laughed and named his character Boxcar Joe the Magic Hobo. The game went along normally for a while and then the first combat happened. Boxcar Joe grabbed a can of tomato soup spent a point of edge grabbed six dice and let fly at one of the guys trying to mug him. We have a rule when it comes to exploding dice: every other time a die 'explodes' the intended effect gets bigger. 27 hits later all seven thugs one of whom was hiding around the comer were dead from the side effects of that thrown can. One gun also discharged into a passing truck instantly killing the driver with a headshot and bringing the delivery van to a crashing halt into the entrance of the alley. Boxcar Joe starts freaking out because stopping the thugs cost him his dinner. Before anyone in the group could console him the back door of the delivery van popped open revealing the randomly rolled for cargo: Assorted foodstuffs The game lasted about six months and in the second to the last session Boxcar Joe lost control of a spell and got thrown into a magic portal out of reality. After that game a couple of our players went their separate ways. We played some games with some new guys and then I ran into one of the dudes who left. He had a story to tell about Boxcar Joe. Waffle House Millionaire 04/22/11Fri01:59 No.14676251 14676140 Turns out that she played in a Delta Green game and one of the guys in the group using some form of random generator ended up creating Boxcar Joe. When she met him for the first time in the game she started laughing about the character saying he sounded like someone from an earlier game: Boxcar Joe the Magic Hobo. At this point according to her telling the group fell silent. They showed her the sheet. Name: Boxcar Joe the Magic Hobo. They then informed her that it was a running joke for a couple of local groups where a musically inclined 'Magic Hobo' With a couch 'in surprisingly good shape' had turned up in more than a few random character generators. Part of the running joke was that Boxcar Joe played merryhell with the dicegods and the laws of probability. So then I asked her to find out when these games happened in relation to ours. After doing some math and a little bit of guesswork I made an interesting discovery: Firstly due to a combination of game schedules and campaign lengths it seems as though Boxcar Joe was not in any two games at once. In parallel running games yes but if one game was on a Tuesday and so was another something would happen that would amount to Boxcar Joe going away for that one session like the guy being sick. Secondly: Every time Boxcar Joe has left a game he hasn't died. At least not In a way that the body was ever found. Sucked into a portal thrown off a cliff Gellar Field failure etc. Almost certain deaths in everycase but no body ever found. Sometimes the game ends and Boxcar Joe just hitches a ride out of town or something never to be seen again. As a result I have a sneaking suspicion that every appearance of the character 'Boxcar Joe' is in fact the same person. Waffle House Millionaire 04/22/11Fri02:07 No.14676321 14676251 As far as my personal theory goes I have two pieces of evidence In my favor: Every instance of his apperance that I can find involved both a random character generator and the laws of probability going right out the window. The implications of this same person appearing in no particular order Dark Heresy Rogue Trader Shadowrun Exalted Old AND New Worlds of Darkness Deadlands Call of Cthulhu Delta Green DRYH Star Wars MAID six different GURPS games DD Faerun Ebberon Dark Sun Spell Jammer and at least two homebrew settings Fantasy Craft Spy Craft and about six different homebrew games Fucked if I know. Not sure I want to. A friend of mine once pointed out that if we swapped the couch out for a phonebooth he would bare an uncanny resemblance to The Doctor. I'd rather not think on that possibility too hard."

The guitar was a custom made one which had some art work on I can't remember the name of the piece but it's a dark blue sky with pillar like points which came in about 559 and I paid for 100. This happened 2day btw so this is fresh in my head. So Maddie my girlfriend and I had a guitar concert within our school and we both auditioned. It rolled round and in the end I came 2nd and she came 4th. We where both so happy about this and I gave her a huge hug infront of the crowd can't wait to see everyone tomorrow that's gonna be a joy.

My child recently gotten the flu. He was never vaxxed and we refused to get vaxs despite the fact the school issuing a letter out asking parents to vax for the flu a lot of schools in our area had flu outbreaks. My husband talked to me after my child was running a 102.7 fever and I finally decided to take him to the hospital. They did a flu test and it came back positive for type 1 and type 2. He couldnt keep fluids down so they asked if he could have fluids in an iv I usually dont allow them to put any kind of needles in my child but they said he could die if not. So after discussing it with my husband we decided to allow him to receive fluids with no medication. After a few days in bed it seemed to only get worse. It got to 103 a couple times. They dud a blood test I know I am stupid and it came back he had a low white blood count. They asked if they could do a blood transfusion. After watching my baby suffer for a whole week I was at a loss. I talked it over with the nurses and they said his case was the worse theyve seen despite a few kids were in the hospital so I let them go for it. I feel like the stupidest idiot now. After the blood transfusion he got better. After 3 days his fever was down and he was discharged. As soon as my baby got home he started having extreme allergic reactions his arms are red and itchy and his eyes are puffy. I think the person that gave the blood had vaccines recently and caused my child to get vaccine injured and gave him extreme allergies has this happened to anyone else Im at a loss for my baby boy

I had HORRIFIC nerve pain and neck/head pain so I tried several different ""alternative"" options and nothing ever really offered a whole lot of relief. I started getting the Botox and steroid injections in my head and down the front and back of my neck and they offered some short term relief only to come back and the need to get more. So I had a nurse friend who had been terminally ill with cancer get in touch and ask me to try a CBD oil she had been using for over a year that not only had her in remission but feeling great. So reluctantly I did order it after doing a LOT of research... OMG.....I cannot Express not only my utter astonishment but my forever gratitude to her... This stuff has changed and improved EVERY ASPECT OF MY LIFE I no longer have to have injections my digestion issues are COMPLETELY resolved they wanted to remove a large portion of my bowel my dysautonomia cardiac issues have been improving daily I am OFF ALL of my antidepressant and antianxiety meds and down from 100mg to 25mg on my Fentanyl patches hope to be completely off by next month and hardly any breakthrough meds Oh I was able to stop my hormone replacement as well. I honestly feel ALIVE again and it is ALL due to the CBD oil I started the end of October 2018. Life gets better EVERY SINGLE DAY and I am actually excited about the future haven't been able to say that in over 14 years Almost all of mine and my husbands family as well as our friends have watched us both change soooo drastically that they too have all started the oils and have AMAZING success stories of their own. I would LOVE to talk to ANYONE that is interested in hearing more about this. This is NOT a sales pitch I am just wanting to share the ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL life changing experience that I have had with my Chiari brother and sisters Please please feel free to contact me if you want to know more and know not all CBD oils are created the same or as ""pure"" as they state Much love to you ALL [BLUE]: Hi [RED] so glad you are getting relief and better health. I would just like to know what CBD oil you are using As i know it is legal there. What strength dosage do you have to take Also is it in oil or capsules Sorry for all the questions. Just really interested in your relief and improved symptoms. [RED]: [BLUE] sending you a pm"

Because well if you've never been successful in one then you wouldn't know how truly amazing they can be. Secondly I hate when people say I am making a mistake and losing money by doing an MLM. With certain ones YES absolutely you can go into debt. But that's not all MLM's. I earnt my ""debt"" back of a whole 129 lol in 2 days. Not only do MLM's offer insanely awesome bonus's and incentives but there's so much room for growth within the company if you bust your ass just like any other job. Not to mention most including mine MLM's allow you to send back your inventory so if you decide not to do it you aren't in debt. Not to mention you build amazing life long friendships with those in your team and those around you. I know my team is filled with amazing women who genuinely want to help other people. Let me put it this way there are 2 sides to every story and to every bad negative story you hear there is a success story There is a mother that was able to pay off her child's hospital bills from when she nearly lost her son. If a company was truly shit they wouldn't be running. Am I saying every MLM is a good idea HELL NO But am I saying that you need to know your facts and learn about the company hell yes. If it was truly bad I WOULDN'T STILL BE DOING THIS lol. Please be nice in the comments I have feelings too."

What can you tell me about the effectiveness of these products What are the average price points Is it good value for money Specifically what are YOUR experiences with the products Telling me I'm so sweet and saying you are offering me this deal first with an added discount is an interesting way to market to me but we have never actually spoken before so it feels a little fake.

Please be careful that you don't sink your time and money into a job that will always take way more hours per week and WAY more of your own momey than you were promised in order to meet your sales goals. Below I have included a few resources for you to start your research. First here's a quick video explaining how multilevel marketing schemes or pyramid schemes as they're often called really work: https:youtu.be/VVUUbEw_Pm8 Next here's an article with a testimonial from a retailer who used to sell for Itworks detailing the lies/exaggerations she was told about how much she would have to work how much she'd have to spend and how she basically had to trick people into buying stuff or joining the company if she wanted to be successful: https://www.wate.com/news/investigations/formerknoxvilleitworksdistributorwarnsotherstocheckthefineprint/792730976 Here's an AMAAsk Me Anything from Reddit with indepth questions asked of a former Itworks employee with detailed answers about her experience: https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/88l8d6/ama_former_it_works_distributor/ Here's a brief article outlining some of the rhetoric/popular talking points that people in multilevel marketing companies will use to entice you or to try to convince you that they are not actually a pyramid scheme preying on unsuspecting victims: https://botwatch.blog/2016/05/10/thethingsmlmssayormlmbingo/ Here's another great and very funnyvideo from Last Week Tonight with Jon Oliver where he and his team have done some great reporting on the dangers of multilevel marketing companies: https://youtu.be/s6MwGeOm8il Finally here's an article detailing another woman's experience with a similar multilevel marketing company called Forever Living. Itworks may sell different products and have different requirements but the company structure is the same. The woman in the article describes the expectations she had going in and the realities she actually faced once she became a distributor: https://botwatch.blog/2016/05/03/mlmexpectationvsreality/ I know Itworks may seem like a great way to make lots of extra money but it is a slippery slope to financial ruin. I urge you to do some research into this company. Much like the wan in that last article the expectations you have versus the realities you will face may be staggeringly different. Protect yourself [BLUE]: [Thumbnail of a hand drawing an illustration of people in a pyramid.] How to Spot a Pyramid Scheme: Don't confuse a pyramid scheme for a legitimate opportunity. See The American Dream Denied: Herbalife Victims Speak Out: https://www.youtube.com/watchvoNM3...: youtube.com [BLUE]: I really wish you all the best and I'm not trying to take money out of your pocket or anything. These companies are incredibly predatory they suck you in and promise you part time hours working from home and extra cash. In reality to be successful in these types of companies you will have to put in at least 8 hours a day 7 days a week. You will have to spend a lot of time out of your house doing sales and parties and training and conferences. Customers will be few and far between as will recruits. You will have to spend lots of money on product to maintain your seller status. Friends will not buy from you some will block you and some will stop talking to you or inviting you to things. Please please please dont let yourself get caught up in this pyramid scheme. It's not good for you or your family. [BLUE]: I know all these messages seem daunting. I know you're just trying to make an honest living and get some extra cash for you and your family. Itworks isn't going to care about you. It will drain your time and resources and you will come out the other side with less money than when you started as well as a bunch of inventory you were never able to sell. I know you are probably very excited about Itworks and the promises they made to you. Don't let yourself be fooled into thinking that this job will be an easy fix. It will be very hard it will hurt you and your bank account. I say all this from experience. If you're hurting for money and think this will get you out of a tight spot please do the research and see what you're really in for. Finding a good job can be so freaking hard and the people at Itworks know that. They make their company seem so inviting especially for young moms but they are money traps. Sorry to get so heavy but you deserve better than to waste your drive on a company that devalues and scams their workers."

b0puxq,https://reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/b0puxq/the_genresavvy_wizard/,https://i.redd.it/rscbzvcfpxl21.png,"Anonymous 03/02/2012 04:17 Spring is when I prefer to crawl out of hibernation . I prefer it to starving to death at least since I'd much rather stay holed up in my study all year. I'd like nothing more than to keep reading the tomes that line the of my tower until my eyes would melt like candles and I would have to learn how to read by smell. But men even geniuses beyond the ken of common men need to eat and to eat I need gold and unless everything has changed since the last time I left my study it tales work and luck to get gold. My preferred method of operation is to make as much gold as quickly as possible which is typically through some risky endeavor involving group of assorted specialists seeking some item or villain or kidnapped something or other. The specifics rarely matter. At this stage in my life I've grown well past the notion of asking the ""why"" of mundane matters since they always follow the simple and constant pattern of ""logic."" I believe it's best to be as direct as possible about indirect things and I should say this clearly. I'm not fond of logic. Logic may be the greatest triumph of the rational mind but upon stepping beyond those boundaries it is a useless tether that inhibits nearly everything I try to do. Logic is the nagging mother who pulls you down to the ground when you try to fly the miserable teacher who denies your answer since it's not the same as the one in his book. As wizard I dedicate myself to the strict principle of completely snubbing logic. Anonymous 03/02/2012 04:18 I found myself in tavern though I'm rather certain that's not where I was trying to go. The calibration of my teleportation crystals must have either been misaligned or they simply were not in the mood and I jotted down quick note to either realign them or scold them when I returned to my tower. Though it not my intended destination it turned out to be suitable place to find an odd assortment of mixed company who were seeking some ancient secret or recent rumor or whatever it is those kind of groups are currently concerned with. The path that magic lays out for me is strange indeed since in only few seconds I noticed just such group huddled in the darkest corner of the tavern and with a sudden blast of hindsight quickly scratched out rather unnecessary addition to my notebook. A blondehaired human man wearing silver inlaid armor was laziIy arguing with black bearded dwarf with eyebrows so thick and long they completely obscured his eyes. Across from them sat an auburnhaired elf with bored expression who was slowly tracing circles upon map with her finger and all of them seemed to share the aura of people waiting for something to happen. Digging into one of my pockets I found my K'yu stone large amethyst cut in the shape of spindle. It remained motionless and so did I until the volume of the two men's argument rose sharply and the gemstone began to vibrate. Anonymous 03/02/2012 04:19 ""Ah shay we don't need one"" the dwarf suddenly bellowed ""They're ill luck and aln could never shtand their anticsh."" 'We don't have choice "" the human said equally loudly but far more calmly "" We don't stand chance without wiz"" ""Wizard"" I asked stepping towards them making sure my pointed hat and robes were excessively visible ""I couldn't help but overhear"" ""Ah bet you c"" the dwarf began. ""Could yes but I ended up overhearing anyways"" I continued ""And I just happened to be looking for work befitting my profession."" The three of them eyed me over for few seconds and while they did I had a sudden epiphany. With my skills and incredible intelligence it made little sense for me to go risking my life following a group of strangers into some unknown dangerous locale all for the sake of treasure that might not even be there. I could simply summon an earth elemental ask it to deliver me some gold and it would locate a natural vein of the material and dig it up all by itself in no time at all. Just as I was about to turn away to begin my profitable new venture the human spoke up. ""It's good that you offered your help for we are in great need of wizard. You see 1000 years ago..."" Anonymous 03/02/2012 04:22 I would have cut him short at that point but politeness demanded that I listen to the full story of all of his ancestors and why it's his destiny to get the something or other. While the man recounted the last several hundred years to a person who likely wrote the book he was reciting from I took the moment to take close examination of the three of them. The human was clearly warrior judging by his build and sense of awareness though his unmarred equipment and light attitude led me to believe he lacked actual combat experience and instead relied on sparring results to satisfy his ego. He had the good son of pride the kind that kept you on the straight and narrow path and made you bathe often though you can't have the good kind without the bad kind. He seemed completely convinced that he was the only one could retrieve the ancient lost... thing and I could only hope he wouldn't get himself needlessly killed. It took me moment but the way his nostrils twitched slightly in very peculiar way whenever he took deep breath convinced me that his name was ""Litaeous DeAllor."" It takes a special kind of genius to be able to learn person's name from such subtle clues but you can't become a wizard if you can't handle such simple deductions. Anonymous 03/02/2012 04:22 The dwarf was a dwarf. Stubborn enjoys ale and devotedly attached to his beard. While this may seem like something that just about any man who knows anything about dwarfs could discern from casual glance at one that's actually rather bigoted idea and you should be little ashamed for thinking that. I assure you that I noticed many fine details that permitted me to be certain that he was a stereotypical dwarf such as the ale tankard in his hand and the beard on his face. Of course thanks to my thorough academic instruction I could read the dwarven runes that he had chiseled onto his and discerned his name was ""Madein Ironhall."" The elf attractive but the distinct callouses on her fingers led me to believe she was well practiced in picking locks and pockets or she enjoyed tickling armadillos under their chins which would develop similar callouses. Either way she not woman I couId easily trust but thankfully my drink arrived halfway through the human's tale and it became that much easier. By watching at what parts of Litaeous's story her ears perked up I realized that she was his childhood friend and that both of them harbored hidden feelings for each other. Likely by the end of this adventure they will have shared few romantic scenes and realized that they had loved each other since the moment they had first met. Unfortunately that means that I would have to come up with excuses to leave the of them alone for lengths of time which meant I would have to drag the dwarf off and spend time with him. Hopefully the dwarf enjoys being regaled by lengthy historicallyrich while highly relevant stories as I would be sure to provide him with these. Anonymous 03/02/2012 04:27 Nice of you to drop by Mr. Pratchett. Anonymous 03/02/2012 04:27 ""Ah'm shick of ya lengthy hishtoricallyrich whahl hahly relevant shtory"" Madein interrupted just as Litaeous was in the middle of explaining how his evil halfbrother had stolen some artifact that prevented some ancient evil from doing something ""Yeah we should go out and do something already"" The elf added. There moment everyone simply stared at each other silently until my K'yu stone began to vibrate. ""Yes should definitely go now as there's no time to waste"" I said moving towards the door. ""Where exactly should we go"" Litaeous asked and he sounded genuinely curious. ""Well if your halfbrother is clearly evil than he'll likely be in clearly evil place. There's place called Castration Mountain not too far from here and that's likely the most evil sounding place for miles."" ""If he'sh anything lahke me he'd shtay far from plashe called Cashtration Mountain"" Madein growled and while I agreed that it wasn't place any sane man would want to venture towards I had to figure out some way to convince him to go. ""...It's misnomer"" I said si mply ""Its name originally came from the old goblin words 'Kas Tershen' which means 'Wide mountain'. The name changed over the centuries until it became known as Castration Mountain."" ""Ah shee.."" Madein muttered ""But that'sh shtill no reashon to think that hish brother"" ""Halfbrother"" Litaeous interjected ""...would go anywhere near the plashe. It'sh a foolsh errand to go there without shome short of proof he'sh there beyond your shilly Iaine of reashoning."" ""I saw that he was there through my crystal ball"" I invented quickly ""so we might as be going."" Anonymous 03/02/2012 04:30 It took us nearly three clays to reach Castration Mountain and during the trip I spent good portion of my time explaining the deep mysteries of magic to Madein while Litaeous and the elf would keep doing that ""glance at each other then quickly look while blushing"" act. It wasn't until we reached the mountain itself that Madein explained to me that he had remarkable talent that of being able to sleep while walking something I hadn't noticed before thanks to his obscenely bushy brows."

b0elqk,https://reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/b0elqk/this_pos_turned_her_childs_many_hours_of/,https://i.redd.it/dii5isk8trl21.jpg,So. This is going to be a long one. But I want to share this and maybe save someone else facing the same thing we did/are. . On Saturday went to a lovely freshwater hole near Murwillumbah with some friends. Having a good old time chatting while the kids swam. This lovely girl came out of the water with a look of utter agony on her face and I knew something was seriously wrong. . We saw 2 prong marks in her big toe and my instant thought was a snake. She had been playing on the other side of the water hole jumping off a rope swing and climbing on a log under the water to hop out when it happened. Her foot slipped and she felt she'd been bitten. In her utter bravery she swam the whole way over to us unaided. . When we saw the wounds The men picked her up and ran her to the car while I was a bit stunned. Left with my friend all the other kids and the other car. . My friend and I packed up the stuff and followed behind and I don't remember much of that drive but as we pulled up to the town we received a call that she was in great pain but she was at the hospital and in good hands. I was so relieved. I was so worried about venom as she had all the signs. . Straight away the hospital staff knew it was a bullrout or freshwater stonefish. . For the next 3 hours I did all I could which wasn't much. Watched my baby shake and sweat and cry as we held her foot in hot water. She also had some local pain injections. They seemed to barely take the edge off. . She was asking for Balance a doTERRA oil blend which thankfully we had on us. She was inhaling it deeply and later she said over and over how it helped her get through the unbearable excruciating pain. . Her pain was at a max in the car. She gave it an 11/10. In the hospital it ranged from 48 in waves. We got off lightly. After 3 hours the pain started to back off. . We were sent home and I made her some oil blends to support. Today it's still sore. She has a huge toe sized blister on her toe where the venom has attacked her flesh. So if you are in the east of Australia plan on swimming in fresh water and are not aware google bullrout. We didn't know they existed. . Praise God she's ok and the pain didn't last longer. He is good . Lots of love

October 2016 struggling to find a job that didn't want to rip me off and it was really disheartening because I knew I was a great worker. Sitting out the front playing on my phone when an opportunity presented itself to work from home I had found just what I needed. Within 4 weeks I had hit my 3rd promotion and I thought I had found my thing lol. I then really started to pay attention to what was going on around me within the company where was my mentor who promised to show me the ways to go to the top 33 there was no contact I turned into a number that helped her get a top promotion. So after 8 months I left that compsny and it's empty promoises I moved to another company again making money but I just had no joy and network marketing had destroyed me.

Let's not forget that there are plenty of illegal but immoral things that one can do. Beauty products like the one you like in your profile are not regulated and have been recalled due to antibioticresistant bacteria and had to be relabled after claims about heavy metals were found to be lies. A growing number of these ""natural"" product lines now have class action lawsuits from causing permanent physical damage. Red you are so right The lack of regulation by the FDA for cosmetic products including baby wash is appalling. That is what makes Beautycounter different we have an active activism program in DC pushing for better regulation. Our mission is to get safer products into the hands of everyone whether they are ones we make or someone else's. We should not have to check labels for harmful ingredients and thorough testing shouldn't be only voluntary. I completely agree with you on that. Blue No you don't get it at all. Your companies products are the ones that lied about heavy metals. Your company had killer bacteria in a product that forced a recall. Regulations would shut it downalthough in this political climate it would depend on whose pockets are lined. Other offmarket ""health and beauty"" companies have a huge line of lawsuits for permanent disfiguration. The products are not safe not at all. In addition real workplaces do not cost money to start up and they pay for things like training and professional development courses. Red they did recall products And they stopped production while they figured it all out. I'd love to hear what completely safe products you are using. Blue Lol. Not yours. Red I'm surprised you don't want to help others. It's clear you know a lot about the safety of cosmetics and I think others would really benefit knowing what products you use since it's clear you would only use something that's completely safe. Blue You fail to understand the danger of what you pedal and the method of which you do it. It's clear your company has lied too about dangerous heavy metal just to make a buck."

Distributors over promised and undelivered because they were greedy or desperate and then people felt mislead. 2. Many people joined tried and failed but didn't want to take responsibility for their failure so they called it a scam. 3. 80 of the people that join never take the time to get properly trained and they go around annoying people that have no respect for the opinion in the first place. 4. When you enter Network Marketing and try to get your friends to follow you are forced to see the quality of that relationship. Many people that you think are your friends feel you are an acquaintance. When they don't get excited or follow people get their feelings hurt. None of this makes Network Marketing a bad business model. Network Marketing does 185 billion a year in sales. That's more than movies and music and video games combined. It's a brilliant yet very misunderstood and often misused business model. Many people say ""ewe"" with out ever understanding it. So what's the solution Work on yourself and become the type of person people want to spend more time with. Read more books go to the gym eat healthier travel more study investing and raise your level of awareness. Care more about people become a better listener and people will start to see you differently. Be a giver and love on people. There are way more bad guys working in other industries but they present themselves better so they don't get made fun of as much crazy huh Food for thought. I am proud and gratefull to be part of Network Marketing and it helps me to become a better person. Besides that I created so many new relationships that bring value to my life"

Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he happily agreed to take the test. Principal: ""What is 3 x 3"" Harry: ""9."" Principal: ""What is 6 x 6 "" Harry: ""36."" And so it went with every question the principal thought a bright 3rd grader should know. The principal looks at MS. Brooks and tells her ""Y'know I reckon Harry can go to the 3rd grade."" But Ms. Brooks is still skeptical of the little bugger and says to the principal ""Not so fast let me ask him a few questions."" The principal and Harry both agree. Ms. Brooks asks ""What does a cow have have four of that I only have two of"" Harry after a moment: ""Legs."" Ms. Brooks: ""What is in your pants that you have but I do not have"" The principal wondered why would she ask such a question Harry replied: ""Pockets."" to the Principal's great relief. Ms. Brooks: ""What does a dog do that a man steps into"" Harry: ""Pants."" By now the principal is sitting forward with his mouth hanging open. Ms. Brooks: ""What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky"" Now the principal's eyes open really wide and before he could intervene Harry replied ""Bubble gum."" Ms. Brooks: ""What does a man do standing up a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs"" Harry: ""Shake hands."" The principal is now trembling with apprehension as Ms. Brooks asks the last question. Ms. Brooks: ""What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' and indicates a great deal of heat and excitement"" Harry: ""Firetruck."" The principal breathes a huge sigh of relief and tells the teacher ""put the little bastard in 5th grade I got the last seven questions wrong myself."""

Immediately she came in she put on a smile in her face and greeted us. I smiled and answered but my partner wasn't happy. Instead he told her it was over. She smiled again. To have been late and all you could do was smile was weird. So I asked why smiling. She told me sometimes all you need is a smile to hide the pains in life. ""I never planned to be late. I'd prepared for weeks for this day but circumstances were responsible for everything. I came from my son's school down here because I was called he fell sick. While driving down here I got a flat tire. I had to park it by the roadside."" I was given a free ride down here. I couldn't forfeit this interview because I had prepared.

If you are dwelling on what you don't have and are doing nothing to change your circumstances then you've come to the right place. I just realized that in December. Money is not the issue it's our concept around it. SOOO lets take this barrier down for a hot minute and visit some facts. My shampoo and conditioner bottles have lasted me THREE MONTHS. Styling products are still halfway full and were bought at the same time. Let me break it down for you in simple math lets not overcomplicate stupid simple. 30 Shampoo 30 Conditioner 60 total 30 days in a month x3 90 days 66 cents a day for 90 Days 60 total and 3 month supply of products An average Venti size coffee order from Starbucks is 4.50 or more. At 4.50 a drink the minimum only spending that 5 days a week for work shifts you are at 270 DOLLARS EVERY 90 DAYS. What. Using the last 3 months as an example if you purchased one less coffee a week you would have 3 to spare and have quality shampoo and conditioner with ingredients that are NOT linked to cancer have 0 ingredients found in antifreeze formaldehyde diethnolamie etc. etc. etc. I could go on for days and compare it to the ""natural"" or ""high end"" brands you're using now.

We teach our daughters to sell Girl Scout cookies in order to teach them important life and entrepreneurial skills.

All money is surrendered to the Girl Scouts of America and those monies stay with the organization. This also applies to school fundraisers sports fundraisers etc I'm not calling out the Girl Scouts btw thank you for the yummy cookies.. and using them as an example because they are very impressive Fast forward 15 years when those little girls grow up and want to sell products that will help them make a paycheck we ridicule them We say ""I'm tired of seeing that stuff on my social media feed Get a REAL job"" You feel that she must be peddling a scam because she actually gets to keep the money that she worked for rather than turn it in to a higher organization.

aygn47,https://reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/aygn47/the_weaver_of_fates/,https://i.imgur.com/Q4fbj7B.png,"Anonymous 05/19/2015 01:54 [Image of a spider. The file name is Did_you_say_guests.jpg.] In my setting we have a rather laid back attitude about gods. Most of the party believe in concepts rather than gods but we had this one cleric who just HAD to be a determined little shit and demanded that I give him the name of the god of fate. Well I caved and gave him 'Archael' the ancient god who weaves the fabric of fate together for all of the cosmos. He was really happy with himself and constantly prayed to this god for like half a dozen levels. Finally they get to a point where they 'somehow' punch through the walls separating the planes of the divine and the planes of the mortal world and enter the ream of the great god Achael himself. Naturally cleric is super PSYCHED about this and talks the rest of the group into searching for him before they return to the mortal world. The agree and set off following the thick white strands that seem to lead to the center temple in the midst of a massive underground cave. The Cleric calls out to his god hoping to gain his attention. To his surprise he does not see a loom in the cave where he had expected the fabric of fate elegantly strewn together. He called out again and startlingly gets an answer. ""Ah Yes Company We do so love company Been an awfully long time since we had some or was it awfully soon time since Has it happened Wait when am I Are we here or are we happening Oh yes the guests"" And at that moment they all look up to see the massive shape of a spider slowly unfurling from its resting place in the ceiling. Achael the ancient mad spidergod of fate. He then treated the entire party to a delightful banquet next to the last adventuring party to find him promptly sitting them next to skeletons wearing armor so ancient that it was crumbling to dust. He even gave the Cleric a farewell gift for being everso faithful. Anonymous 02:35 [Image of a spider. The file name is I_do_so_love_company.jpg.] Of course not anon. That would be rude. Archael got real close to the cleric and handed him a wonderful little box adorned with a cute little ribbon. ""Wwhat is it Lord Archael"" ""A little something for your continued service Go on Open it"" ""It's a... scarf"" ""Yes Yes Yes A scarf so your neck won't ever become too cold Can't have my cleric freezing while doing important things"" ""Tthanks Lord Archael I shall treasure it always..."" ""Oh I am ever so happy will be happy No I am happy right now that's what happened yes ever so happy that you like it I made it entirely myself"" ""How so my lord"" ""I reused some old strings of fate I didn't use in the web All the extras that I didn't need from some raggy old pile."" ""Which pile"" At this point Archael leans in as close as he can to the cleric's face chittering excitedly with his many mouth parts ""Extinction events. If you listen to the scarf carefully you can even hear the mass genocides in between the cries of the millions of suffering souls."" And that's how the cleric acquired the Scarf of Tormented Possibilities and must make a saving will throw against the scarf to remain sane. Archael also calls him up constantly and sends gifts every 1d205 days. Anonymous 18:17 [Image of a spider. The file name is May_I_be_a_bother_good_chaps.jpg.] Well he contacts them every 1d10 days with a small favor to ask and usually ends up giving them a reward which while incredibly useful is also terrifying due to the nature of manipulating fate. As for gifts I've made it a point to send as many disturbing things to the cleric as possibly to really 'test his faith' and because the player in reality is not a fan of spiders. I don't usually give him items that have any 'real' value in game because I don't want to break the game by constantly giving armor so it's mostly trinkets: ""The Black Mirror of Broken Fate"" Gazing into it reveals possible futures to the viewer but not all futures are easy to witness. Has a chance to grant the cleric a perception boost if he sees a possible future but also can inflict a lowered will score if he sees something terrifying. Crafted from a broken piece of Archael's shell and engraved with the clerics name followed by a '3' ""The Plate of Lost Possibilities"" Ancient plate from a previous worshiper. No real mechanical boosts Archael just thought he would like it. I nice little dish if you don't mind the bloodstain. And the screaming. ""The Viewing Orb"" Giant orb that grants visions to cleric as if he were an oracle. I encourage them to use it if they can't find a quest hook or need a push in the right direction. Really useful. They can't shake the feeling that the orb is watching them when they sleep though. ""The Scepter of Archael"" An artifact created by the ancient god himself. Literally no mechanical purpose besides Archael enjoying looking at it. Also gives him an excuse to 'visit'. He's done so 5 times."

What's even more awesome is that I used to buy 7 bottles of products to use each month and another bottle to help with energy when needed. Now I buy 1 pack that has 4 products in it that have everything I need.

He's been hopping off the comet and landing all over the planet for centuries so almost every culture has terrible legends about the comet by now.

I launched my new nontoxic hair care business I'm obsessed with the products. If it's not a fit for you and that's totally okay however I would really appreciate it if you shared my information to anyone that might complain about their hair for any reason hair loss damage thinning brittle frizz trying to grow it out etc. or if someone needs a second stream of income. I would love to help them I'm super excited and I appreciate your support. I would love to send you some before and after's as well. I have personally seen amazing results Would you be interested in learning more [BLUE]: What's the business called [BLUE]: Tell me about it [BLACK]: The company is called Monat its an all natural hair care line. What I love most about them is that they are leaping bunny approved and they are vegan. They also perform. I have been using it to get rid of my frizzy hair and help my curls become more pronounced. There are also different ways you can get involved you can buy retail become a VIP or you can become a market partner and make a little or a lot of extra cash. They have a bunch of different products that help with different things. Even if you don't have anything you would like to change about your hair Monat has no bad chemicals so it helps make your hair healthier stronger and grow faster. [BLUE]: Isn't that the company that causes chemical burns and balding [BLACK]: Its the company that was accused of it yes. I have done research on it before I got involved and I found out that shampoo and conditioner does not cause those types of issues. The people that experienced it either 1. had some health issue that caused hair loss or they were a hair stylist who was threatened by the success Monat was having so they spread the rumors that Monat products did that. If I had one doubt in my mind that Monat could cause that kind of damage I would not have started my business with them. [BLUE]: I understand girl I would consider your offer but I have just started my own business with this amazing teeth whitening tooth paste . It's something that has shown results and if you're interested just know it has: No bleaches No peroxide harsh chemicals or sugars Dentist recommended Kids it Amazing for wine coffee and nicotine Whitens caps and veneers Way less than whitening strips If you know anyone looking for it let me know 3 month supply is ONLY 179.99 It's helping pay the cost of my wedding In just 8 days I could afford a private jet plane to Maui for the Honeymoon [BLACK]: That's awesome Good luck to you.

On Thursday I took my 4 year old son to our holistic pediatrician to go over the results of blood/urine testing. [REDACTED] has been seeing her for over a year and every 3 months she does testing then provides us with a dietary/supplement plan and then retests his numbers to make sure he is doing well with the program he is on. Well yesterday she starts our appointment with ""WOW he is doing SO well"" She tells me his inflammation in his body has gone down significantly he is absorbing his nutrients his gut bacteria looks healthy/in balance and that I should continue exactly what I have been doing and see her again in another 6 months as we may not need to continue seeing her if his results continue this way. I told her that the past 45 months I added a gut health regime in addition to the supplements she has suggested and that apparently it is working She wanted to know what I was giving him and I told her. She said ""keep it up mama cause its working"". She looked at [REDACTED] playing happily in her office and said ""he is a different kid then when we first started"". Back story [REDACTED] struggled with sensory issues the world just overwhelmed him significant speech delay behind developmentally didn't sleep well very moody/massive meltdowns/difficult to soothe allergies eczema irregular bowels. He no longer has any of these issues except somewhat of a speech delay but it has improved tremendously with healing his gut and working with a neurodevelopmental specialist. I know though that a main reason he is doing so well is because of his healthy gut. Not only have I been working on [REDACTED] gut health but I have also been on a similar journey or the past 8 months and see huge improvements in my own health/mental health: Improved energy can better keep up with my son's high energy Improved mood no more depressed/unmotivated/negative mindset Decrease in anxiety almost none No more ""hangry"" episodes from unbalanced blood sugar I'm cool calm collected Decrease in inflammation l lost 810 lbs without even setting that intention Back to healthy prebaby weight finally Sleeping soundly No more indigestion/bloating or bowel issues I know TMI lol but its true I share because I care If sharing my story could help at least one person/child also feel better then my life is just that much more complete. Please reach out if any of this resonates with you or you want to know more I would love to hear from you."

There is a lot of oil out there that can do more harm then good especially when administered wrong. Also a lot of Mims sell cbd oildoterrahempworxyoungliving that are low tier or non effective. Id go to your vet and consult with them to start and then work from there. [REDACTED]: are you serious. Hempworx is very good quality sourced from Gencanna farms. They also have a FDA approved lab. That's a pretty harsh assumption just because it's a MLM. They use great quality ingredients. [REDACTED]: Not an assumption just normal research ive done across multiple hemp sites that have done reviews. Its only been recently introduced and even though they could have an FDA approved lab i havent found any information on the matter that doesnt mean the product is fully approved or effective. There are no proper markings on the product to indicate they have passed screening from governing agencies last time i checked CBD oil in general has not been extensively tested or had years of clincal trials. This is in a new phase and needs to be handled with caution. All im saying is people need to do research for themselves before they start administering oils on themselves or pets. [REDACTED]: Yes it's currently not FDA approved but that does not mean it doesn't work. Everyone should research ingredients and quality. There are many FDA approved drugs on the market today that are dangerous so that doesn't mean much. There is plenty of research on project CBD and other sources on the benefits of CBD plus hemp seed extract oil. [REDACTED]: I 100 agree with you. There are many dangerous FDA approved drugs when used improperly. Thats why they are approved because we now know the limits of them and how to properly take them. Im also not saying CBD oil doesnt work it has beneficial properties and I believe it has its place in health/beauty. Im just saying MLM products arent worth it. Its all marked up standard grade products. Also the hoops that need to be jumped through to recieve the oil is pure insanity. On your site i need to sign up as a recurring customer or for an extra 20 on my order i can start selling products myselfmarket saturation/your losing clientele for an extra 20 sales profit. 1 product will cost me 70. Doing quick internet search i found multiple websites that will sell me the same product with the same claims of being 100 organic and the highest quality ingredients at a range of 2535 one even has a 30 day supply for 40.

We can all use a little help and this has been a great opportunity for me I work from home using my phone and laptop for a global wellness company similar to Costco and the Honest Company. It's ideal for anyone who needs extra reliable income. The hours are extremely flexible so you can put in as much or as little time as you want and I have been able to do it around my daughters' schedule. This has been an amazing opportunity that has allowed me to be able to stay home with my twin baby girls. There is no inventory or selling just honest people and an honest company. The best part is that it helps support a nonprofit that helps kids with cancer It has really been working for me and I would love to share it And if you aren't looking to earn extra money but just want safer products for your home and your family I can help with that too

You do realize that you're exchanging saliva when you kiss someone. Saliva is the least of your problems when it comes to that. Besides if they knew what they were doing they wouldn't need to lubricate it with saliva. Your vagina had mucous glands. I'm not sure if you've ever touched your self but when you're sexually aroused those ducts secrete the body's own lubricant that's why people say ""she's wet."" So if you were sexually aroused then your ducts would open and secret it. There for the need of your partners saliva would become almost zero. Besides some people more specifically guys don't know the female anatomy very well so most of them have no idea what they're doing. Some of the gay girls I know are aware of their female parts but don't know how to work it so it could very well be possible that you weren't sexually aroused there for causing unnecessary friction and discomfort or that they just had no fucking clue what they were doing.

He's actually running and I know he'll win. His name is Jason [REDACTED] he's one of 6 chairman's of php and he happens to work out of the [REDACTED] office that I'm in. He grew up in a single parent household without a dad. His mom was disabled so she couldn't work. He had to take care of his mom and his 2 younger brothers from he age 12 and onwards. They were living off of 1200 welfare checks from the government each month. And now he's a multi millionaire. And I'm one of his favorite people in the office too lmao. Anyways PHP is making me into the person who I could never even imagine I'd turn into. Everything is going so great in my life I couldn't ask for anything more. I love helping families out with what I do it's amazing to see how happy they are after I help them out. When I tell y'all this is the greatest thing to ever happen to my life I'm not joking. I've made my closest friends in this business too even though they're all many years older than me lol. And we're all gonna become successful as fuck together. Nothing better than being surrounded by winners all the time. Honestly before PHP my life was really shit. Sometimes God just needs to take away all that clutter in your life so that you can reorganize your priorities. And I really fucking needed that. I've never fought how hard I'm fighting rn which means I'm gonna win more than I've ever won before and I'm already seeing it. But I ain't stopping this is just the first level of many more to come.

[REDACTED] wrote this for Oil [REDACTED] and she is the math and comp plan QUEEN Let's talk about PGV. When you're going for Silver or a higher rank you need 1000PGV. PGV is basically any volume outside of your qualifying legs including your own personal orders. There are a couple more stipulations to this at higher ranks but for the sake of this example we'll keep it real simple. The purpose of the PGV requirement is to ensure you're building toward the next rank. At Silver you need two legs at 4k and PGV of 1k with an OGV of 10k. The idea here is that you're building a 3rd leg to get to Gold. When you're going for Gold you need 3 legs at 6k each and PGV of 1k. The idea there being that you're working on a leg 4 to get to Platinum and so on. The 1000PGV doesn't have to be contained in one leg however. And remember your own personal orders always count toward PGV. Let's say you're going for Silver. You have two legs at well over 4k each a third leg at 470 and your ER has processed at 100. You are currently ranking as executive with an OGV of about 20000. Oily Tools says your Exec check is 400 and your Silver check would be 900. It's the last day of the month and you've exhausted all your resources and fence sitters. You're deciding if it makes sense to place another order for 430PV about 486 all in to rank to Silver. Keep in mind that the initial 100PV on your ER order is a sunk cost. It is already spent regardless of whatever rank you are going for and whatever your check amount is. So the question is do you spend 486 to make an additional 500 Let me put it a different way: Do you spend 486 to get 486 worth o products of your choosing and 500 ca Keep in mind an order of that size quali for another 250ish worth of promos s you're really spending 486 to get 736 products and 500 cash. Now let's say all of the above still appli BUT you have somebody in your downli who is about to rank as Silver. When you Silver the first Silver in a leg is genera worth about 140 more one share plus an additional .5 because you'ore now mak 3 on their downline instead of 2.5. T 5 varies greatly depending on who is i Fast Start but a fair estimate is about 50100. Meaning that Silver is worth about 200250 to you IF you are also Silver. So if this person is getting to Silv your pay difference between Executive Silver is now about 750. Do you spend 486 to get 750 In othe words do you spend 486 to get 736 worth of products remember those promos and 750 in cash I realize in both of these examples you're putting money out before you see it come back to you. You're purchasing products that you will receive and essentially YL then sends you those products and a check to cover the cost of those products and then some. Remember when Si6 used to mean a free 120 oils Some people are pretty bummed they didn't qualify for that. Guess what this is This is a chance to get whichever oils you choose BASICALLY FREE from Young Living You know what The Aroma complete is awesome but some of the oils are a little random and lots of them are Vitality. What if you just used this as a chance to compile an Aroma Complete of your choosing What oils have you always wanted and wished were in that Aroma complete you didn't get BUILD YOUR OWN. FOR FREE. What if you grabbed some new supplements for your family Some Ninxia Red to keep you guys above the wellness line Try the skincare line Grab something you'd never normally order because HEY IT'S FREE The more YL products you try and love and share about the more your team will try and love and share about. People who are successful in this business USE LOTS OF YL PRODUCTS. Just ask me how much I buy a month. Actually don't What if you snag some oils to send to people on your team to show your appreciation for all their hard work Stock up on Vitality oils to gift to people who just NEED THEM Grab an extra kit or diffuser to loan out That one has like a 90 success rate in getting people to buy a kit. Stock up on popular singles and blends to run a flash sale to increase orders YOU GUYS BE A RIVER. I swear to you everything you give away will come back to you abundantly. I run regular flash sales and somehow my oil stash is ever increasing. Give things away. Anyway what's the conclusion Worth Even if the difference was a break even close to a break even I always say YES. Free oils and free money. And if this kee happening it may be time to get crackin on building that next leg [Blue and white watercolor background black text overlaid:] SHOULD I BUY MY PGV BUILD AN AROMA COMPLETE FOR FR

In order to earn these commissions distributors had to spend money on product. They also would have to spend time and money promoting and growing their business.

There's a a hell of a lot of toxic bullshit in there. But when I was a tiny princess my dad used to be my royal advisor [sic]. He would come to me and over tea we would discuss the problems of the kingdom. He would tell me that new people wanted to move to the kingdom and ask me what we should do. Or he would tell me that the teddybears [sic] and dolls were fighting over the enchanted forest and ask me what to do. Basically he took the trappings of the princess culture and used it as a tool to teach me about leader ship civic responsibility and compassion. So if you have a little princess around consider helping her figure out how to run her kingdom. There's no sense in telling a kid they can't be a leader or that they can't wear sparkles while they do it. Parenting: You're doing it right.

Please find the description of the paused video following the transcription of the text from the image. The respondent's user name has been blacked out. The users reply says: My mother and her driver actually were following a ghost car one night when they were returning from work. This was in the forested hills of Spaldings in Jamaica. Every time they tried to pass it it would swerve over in front of them until they came to a steep corner and it just disappeared It did not go over the side of the hill they checked and there were no roads to turn off on... It just vanished True story I used to hate driving through those hills at night Sometimes you would pass by someone walking in the same direction you are driving and then a mile or two up you'd pass that same person dressed the same way with the same walk going up the hill Sometimes you'd pass them more than twice You just don't say anything and try not to look out your window I would never drive through those hills alone at night This ends the users reply. Description of image seen in the paused video: The YouTube video is paused at 2 minutes 28 seconds of a 10 minute 49 second video. The title of the video has been blacked out. The words deep dark fears appears in all capital letters at the top of the paused video. Two comic frames can be seen in the paused video. The first frame shows a bearded man wearing glasses holding a child over his shoulder. The child shouts Aaah A ghost to which the man responds Uhhuh. Where.

Meanwhile we're all playing young kind of weeaboo anime hero types. We tolerated him and how often he'd talk about how drunk smelly and generally obnoxious his character was. He would use metagame knowledge to make fun of our characters in character laughing at us when we'd get knocked out calling us cowards when we failed our fear checks and the DM would take pity on us and just kind of give us ""let it slide"" looks and let us take rerolls. We'd bitch about it between sessions and we sort of grew to hate the guy as a player His character would go into long diatribes about dungeons and gold and how useless we were and we'd get into hour long arguments where the DM would constantly have to remind us all to ""keep it in IC."" Anyway this campaign goes on for at least a year and the storyline is kind of climaxing and a DMNPC gets kidnapped so after another argument session we get convinced by ""THAT GUY"" to take a suicide mission and storm a castle and he's basically yelling at us IRL we have to do it. Anonymous So when we agree he leaves the room with the DM for a few minutes and we assume this is all some metaplot how he's going to fuck us over and steal our shit. They come back in as if nothing had happened. Session continues but we're all on guard assuming something is up. We storm the castle or whatever and have a lot of fun not really noticing that this guy has stopped being so obnoxious. He hasn't once mentioned how his character reeks of whiskey or onions or whatever though he wastes a good five minutes explaining how his character shaved his beard. Whatever we just assume the DM talked to him about how it was annoying us. Epic battles ensue and Fast forward to face off with the BBEG some Lich thing and the fight isnt going so well. We're getting spanked our Cleric is down and Mr. Fighter has a haste and out of nowhere he goes ""I rush to Cedric the Cleric and slap him 'GET UP YOU COWARD'."" At this point I groan but the DM is like ""Cedric you're back up with XX HP."" Then Mr. ""Fighter"" goes ""I turn to the Lich and I smite him."" And suddenly it clicked for all of us. Fucker had been playing a Paladin the entire time. His insults were his layonhands and calling us out as cowards were his Antifear aura. He wasn't ""That Guy"" we were ""that guy"" and we'd just been absolutely out roleplayed for almost a year."

We've talked numerous times before but you just seem to keep doubting yourself. Maybe you're scared. Maybe you have uncertainties. Maybe you have BOTH and you're in such a bind that you can't even fathom ItWorks changing your life. But live got news for you. It can. It will. And the ONLY thing keeping you from spending that 20 is you actually DOING IT. So stop doubting. The real thing you're doubting is YOU. My 1 goal every single day is to mentor coach educate and train my teammates in a positive way so they NEVER doubt themselves. This is ALL I do for work. You get me 24/7 and that speaks volumes for how successful YOU will be able to become So if you're on the fence and you're stuck my advice is to jump off that fence and take a leap of faith. Spend that 20 and change your life. The phrase ""Nobody is going to save you"" is now FALSE. I'm going to help save you. The choice is yours. Reach Higher... or Have Fear Let's get on the Offense and FIGHT Let's do this The time is now You won't regret it"

It was actually very rude and hurting to come up to me and insult my hatwear much like it was rude for me to insult your shirt. Third: maybe you shouldn't generalize and make wild accusations of a person based on their clothing.

In fact thanks to my own bad decisions I put some weight back on and my business has slowed down. There. I said it. And you know what I'm NOT ashamed. Because I'm human. No matter what job career or business I choose I WILL fail while I'm there. What counts is what I do after the failure. I'm using it as a step to success. Why do I stick with PLEXUS Because even after falling down I'm still a healthy nonmedicated 48 year old woman. No HBP sugar problems cholesterol issues insomnia migraines fatigue or middle aged crazies. Why do I stick with PLEXUS Because in the worst of times where the business/income is concerned we still didn't need to look for full time jobs. Why do I stick with PLEXUS Because I get to cook volunteer play with puppies travel spend time with family and friends whenever I want to. Not when someone approves my time off. Why do I stick with PLEXUS Because after falling down PLEXUS people and products make it so much easier to get back up. I'm coming up on 8 years with this company. Still watching to see when I'll quit Don't hold your breath. Still watching and wondering if it's a good fit for you I'll keep that one simple. IT IS I'm PLEXUS for life y'all.

[The text is a comment to OP] The person at the bottom of my organisation makes a living wage and is guaranteed that wage every month that they work. They are also guaranteed pension medical aid and unemployment benefits when they lose their job. 99 of the people who participate in MLMs lose money and never turn a profit. But sure tell me how working for a guaranteed salary with benefits is the real scam Karen. Orange: Wrong. It's called work ethic. The people that fail at mlm are usually the people that give up when they hear NO or they lack work ethic. People expect to be at the top without putting time or energy in. It happens at mlm and at a regular job. I don't actually work in mlm however I see some of my MLM friends and family living a happier life. Mlm is hard at the beginning but if your can work on self development and staying the course the rewards will be better than any 95 job. Also with MLM you can developing residual income and your own hours this allows for a better work/ life balance. Most people that work regular jobs live pay cheque to pay cheque and they hate their jobs. So why go to a job you hate I say take the chance and try mlm MLM jobs seperated the winners from the loser. And if you fail you can go back to your regular job that consists of losers and minimal comfort.

You know Dollar Tree makeup Claire's play makeup and even your beloved brand names at the big box stores. Not only are there dangerous colors and chemicals we definitely don't want on our daughter's skin but many of those chemicals are known to be hormone disruptors. This my sweet Nadelyn. A friend was over this weekend and she brought with her some crap lipstick. I didn't know they were playing with it. Things like this SHOULD BE harmless. They aren't anymore. Norah had the lipstick on and kissed Nadelynls cheek. This is the result. I have no idea what's going on here. What I do know is that when I attempted to spray a YL product on her face all the redness spread even more. Now I don't blame the YL spray. I actually know just one or two things about chemical reactions and I'm convinced the toxins in the lipstick were reacting with my natural solution. The spray was drawing the toxins out. This picture is the result of the lipstick. In the comments is her face 10 minutes after the YL spray. Moral of the story: Cheap make up is NOT worth it. You might be saving a few bucks but the long term damage the things we don't see on the skin immediately are much more costly. Please mamas go trash all the cheap makeup today. Do a good thing for your daughter's hormones and body

The user posting the review has a blank profile photo and the name is obscured. The user has rated the shop 3 stars out of 5.] I booked online rentals because of the discount. The service was great. We met with friendly and helpful staff everyday however none of them seem to be able to solve our illfitting boot problem which was causing us significant pain. As relative beginners we depended solely on their recommendations and honestly they were not helpful. So I endured three days of quite severe shin pain and my husband quit skiing all together and went for snowboarding. This simple switch added another 35 to our total bill. We both had skied before and none of us recall such problem with boots. The store is also located the furthest from the lifts/gondola so our illfitted boots made the problem even worse. My impression is that their inventory and options are relatively limited which made fitting us more difficult for them. We will not rent from them again. Black of Fleischer Sport: As the owner of my store I know how important boot fitting is and that is why we carry 5 different types of boots for rental/demo in the store. To here you had boot isuues we couldn't fix is a total surprise and the fact that you said you were charged for switching to snowboarding cannot be true since we exchange skis to snowboards for FREE. I aslo have phone numbers emails and names of all clients in my computer since you have to give us this information to rent from us and I don't have you in the system therefore this is an entirely fictitious review. Thank you and if you feel otherwise read this and want to talk about this in person please call the store at phone number talk to me Black and I will comp you one full week of skiing or snowboarding and I will even buy you a 5 day lift ticket. That is how confident I am in my store equipment and most importantly me and my staff of professionals. Thats also why we have been voted Steamboat's 1 ski shop for the past 8 straight years we have been in business.

But I work for Vector selling Cutco knives. The job is super easy and super fun and I highly recommend everyone to at least try it to see how they like it. In 12 days I've made about 1100 cash and about 1100 in prizes so the job isn't bad. All you need is the right mindset and a working car. I'm not really good at giving all of the details but I can give you the number to my office which is in Denville and you can give them a call and tell them you might be interested. Then they will tell you all about the job and they have you come in for an interview and it all goes uphill from there. So give them a call at any time at [REDACTED] [BLUE]: So what do you think 1/14/15 7:56 PM [BLUE]: Hey I'm actually at work now. If you are still interested or even skeptical about the job I can call you real quick and hand the phone to a manager and they can give you everything you need to know about the job

Brought her home and checked her I'd [sic] while she was sitting on the couch. Standing over her I grabbed her by the chin so she would look up at me and asked her what a tight little barely legal teen was doing going home with older men. I told her she must be looking for trouble. And she said she's always been a bad girl. I told her to lift up her arms and pulled her shirt up over her nose and told her to pull her arms back through. I tied the shirt around her eye's and told her she would be taught a lesson. I went and grabbed a wooden spoon from my kitchen cabinet and dragged her by her hair into my room. I dragged her into compute chair which rocks and started spanking her. Don't you know that you could get fucked little girl. And she said that's what she was hoping for. I unnapped her bra pulled down her yoga pants and fucked her senseless. Came on her face. And sent her out the door with a booty Slap. Never to see her again.

The increase in dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway results in acute psychosis resulting in homicidal ideation delusions and hallucinations. Hugging breastfeeding women results in them losing the ability to feed their children because of the surge in dopamine inhibiting prolactin via the tuberinfundicular pathway. On the plus side you help people with Parkinson's disease by increasing dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway so while you don't find any romantic success you find fulfillment volunteering in assisted living facilities. 1.7k karma Pariahdog119: I know some of these words 543 karma MasterOfNap Oh nice could you explain the words ""romantic success"" to me 479 karma"
